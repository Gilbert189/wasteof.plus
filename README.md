# wasteof.plus
wasteof.plus is in early alpha stages. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR ACTUAL PURPOSES OR EXPECT IT TO WORK CORRECTLY. IT HAS ONLY BEEN WORKED ON FOR 1 DAY. Feel free to test and give feedback though â˜º

i am publishing the source code so that community can submit contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Features:
- Adds beta, banned, admin, and verified badges next to usernames across the site. (in messages, on your feed, on explore, and on profiles)
- Shows online status dot indicator across the site. (same places as above)

## TODO (not in any particular order):
- Typescript
- Improve loading of addons when user navigates around site (**help needed**). Right now, the page must reload to load addons onto a page.
- Make badges show on following/followers pages
- Create popup that allows user to toggle on/off different addons
- Make the extension work in firefox (right now it uses chrome.tabs/chrome.scripting, etc.)
- Create emoji picker addon
- Clean up code
- Create a logo and extension icon

## Motivation
Make wasteof.money better by adding cool community-requested features that may or may not necessarily fit into the actual social media and may or may not be wanted by everybody (users will have the option to turn on/off addons.)
