# wasteof.addons

## Features:
- Adds beta, banned, admin, and verified badges next to usernames across the site.
- Shows online status dot indicator across the site.

## TODO (not in any particular order):
- Typescript
- Improve loading of addons when user navigates around site (**help needed**). Right now, the page must reload to load addons onto a page.
- Make badges show on following/followers pages
- Create popup that allows user to toggle on/off different addons
- Make the extension work in firefox (right now it uses chrome.tabs/chrome.scripting, etc.)
- Create emoji picker addon
- Clean up code
